# Satellite-Image-Classification

## Objective:
- First use Principal Component Analysis (PCA) to reduce the dimensions while preserving most of the information. 
- Build Machine Learning model to classify the satellite images into their respective classes and also compare the performance of different models based on accuracy and f1_score metric.
